# Beckett (BGS) — Grading Standards

## Introduction  
Beckett Grading Services (BGS) evaluates trading cards (sports, non-sports, gaming) using a 10-point scale (including half points) and four sub-grade categories: centering, corners, edges and surface.  [oai_citation:0‡Beckett](https://www.beckett.com/grading-standards?utm_source=chatgpt.com)  
This document sets out a rule set for grading in line with Beckett’s publicly-stated criteria.

## Sub-grade Categories  
Each card is evaluated in the following four key areas:  
- **Centering** — how well the card’s image is aligned inside its borders (front and back).  [oai_citation:1‡Beckett](https://www.beckett.com/grading-standards?utm_source=chatgpt.com)  
- **Corners** — condition of the four corners: dings, rounding, fraying.  [oai_citation:2‡Beckett](https://www.beckett.com/grading-standards?utm_source=chatgpt.com)  
- **Edges** — condition of the card edges: chipping, notching, layering.  [oai_citation:3‡Beckett](https://www.beckett.com/grading-standards?utm_source=chatgpt.com)  
- **Surface** — condition of the front and back surfaces: print spots, gloss, scratches, focus/registration issues.  [oai_citation:4‡Beckett](https://www.beckett.com/grading-standards?utm_source=chatgpt.com)  

A card with high sub-grades in all four categories will receive a high overall numerical grade; lower sub-grades reduce the overall grade.  [oai_citation:5‡Beckett](https://www.beckett.com/grading?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

## Numeric Grades — Standard Cards  
Below are Beckett’s main grades and their criteria (extracted/condensed from Beckett’s published scale).  [oai_citation:6‡Beckett](https://www.beckett.com/grading/scale?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

[oai_citation:17‡Beckett](https://www.beckett.com/grading/scale?utm_source=chatgpt.com) |

**Note:** Half-point grades (e.g., 8.5, 7.5) are used by Beckett in increments of 0.5 for cards that sit between the described levels.  [oai_citation:18‡Beckett](https://www.beckett.com/grading/scale?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

## Autograph Grading  
Beckett also applies a numerical scale (10 to 1) for autographs. The autograph grade is distinct from the card condition grade and focuses on the signature quality.  [oai_citation:19‡Beckett](https://www.beckett.com/grading-standards?utm_source=chatgpt.com)  

| Grade | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **10** | A beautiful, boldly signed autograph with near-perfect appearance to the naked eye; under normal viewing looks aesthetically pleasing; only minimal natural pen stroke streak allowed.  [oai_citation:20‡Beckett](https://www.beckett.com/grading-standards?utm_source=chatgpt.com) |
| **9** | A very pleasing signature with slight imperfections; very light bubbling or micro scratching allowed; no yellowing, fading or smearing; positioning nearly perfect (just tips of letters cut off or hidden).  [oai_citation:21‡Beckett](https://www.beckett.com/grading-standards?utm_source=chatgpt.com) |
| **8** | Some noticeable flaws begin to show; signature still solid and pleasing; might have moderate bubbling/scratching; light yellowing/fading/smearing allowed; in cut/sticker auto only up to ~10% missing or small tip running off edge.  [oai_citation:22‡Beckett](https://www.beckett.com/grading-standards?utm_source=chatgpt.com) |
| **7** | Flaws are evident: heavy bubbling, noticeable scratching, minor but obvious yellowing/fading, small portions smeared; up to ~20% of auto may be hidden/missing in cut/sticker; portion may run off card or edge.  [oai_citation:23‡Beckett](https://www.beckett.com/grading-standards?utm_source=chatgpt.com) |
| **6** | Heavy flaws easily visible and very distracting: sections of signature almost invisible, significant yellowing/fading/smearing; up to ~35% missing in cut/sticker; several letters may run off card or bleed onto edge.  [oai_citation:24‡Beckett](https://www.beckett.com/grading-standards?utm_source=chatgpt.com) |
| **5** | Very heavy flaws: large portions missing or invisible; massive fading/yellowing/smearing; over 50% missing in cut/sticker; signature severely compromised.  [oai_citation:25‡Beckett](https://www.beckett.com/grading-standards?utm_source=chatgpt.com) |
| **4 / 3 / 2 / 1** | Levels of decreasing legibility, heavy damage and extreme deterioration of signature; progressively worse eye-appeal and integrity of autograph.  [oai_citation:26‡beckett-authentication.com](https://www.beckett-authentication.com/services/grading?utm_source=chatgpt.com) |

## Notes & Considerations for Your Rule Set  
- **Pre-conditions**: Before applying numeric grading, check for alteration, trimming, cleaning or other modifications. If found, consider authentic/altered designation rather than standard numeric grade. (Although not as explicitly detailed on Beckett’s scale as other companies, good practice.)  
- **Sub-grade logic**: Your implementation should compute or store sub-grades for centering/corners/edges/surface, and use them to derive or validate the final numeric grade.  
- **Half-point increments**: Beckett allows grades in half-point increments (e.g., 9.5, 8.5), which must be accounted for in your grading logic.  [oai_citation:27‡Beckett](https://www.beckett.com/grading-standards?utm_source=chatgpt.com)  
- **Black Label distinction**: Beckett’s “Black Label” represents cards that achieve 10 in all four subgrades (i.e., perfect in centering/corners/edges/surface).  [oai_citation:28‡thesubcenter.co.uk](https://thesubcenter.co.uk/beckett-grading/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)  
- **Back side/back surface matters**: Centering and surface on the back of the card are explicitly considered (e.g., centering “60/40 or better on back” for Pristine 10) so your rules must account for both front and back.  [oai_citation:29‡Beckett](https://www.beckett.com/grading/scale?utm_source=chatgpt.com)  
- **Gloss, metallic print lines, diamond cut**: Some specific defects (metallic print lines, diamond cutting, wax stains, notching) are mentioned in the criteria; if your rules engine supports defect categories, include these as possible defect types with thresholds.  
- **Autograph branch**: If implementing grading for autographed cards, branch to the autograph grading scale above rather than (or in addition to) the card condition grade.  
- **Documentation/imprecision**: Beckett’s public criteria are described as “basic criteria” and disclaimers note that these are general guidelines.  [oai_citation:30‡Beckett](https://www.beckett.com/grading-standards?utm_source=chatgpt.com) Your ruleset should allow for expert judgement or override when needed.
