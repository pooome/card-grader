### **FAIR 1.5 (PSA 1.5)**
A PSA 1.5 card’s condition:

> Note: Card missing solid pieces of the card (major tear, missing layer/back layer, entire corner) may **not** achieve this grade.  [oai_citation:11‡Professional Sports Authenticator (PSA)](https://www.psacard.com/gradingstandards)

### **POOR 1 (PSA 1)**
A PSA 1:
- Exhibits many same qualities as 1.5 but more severely advanced  
- Eye appeal nearly vanished  
- May be missing one or two small pieces  
- Major creasing nearly through all layers of cardboard

## Half-Point Increments
Cards that exhibit **high-end qualities** within each particular grade bracket (between PSA 2 and PSA 9) may achieve a half-point increase. The primary focus remains on centering.  [oai_citation:13‡Professional Sports Authenticator (PSA)](https://www.psacard.com/gradingstandards)

---

## Non-Numerical (Grade-less) Designations
- **Authentic (N0):** PSA is certifying the item is genuine, *without* a numerical grade. This may be due to alteration, major defect, or card submitted ungraded on purpose.  [oai_citation:14‡Professional Sports Authenticator (PSA)](https://www.psacard.com/gradingstandards)  
- **Authentic Altered (AA):** Item is genuine but shows alteration (trimming, recoloring, restoration, cleaning). No numerical grade is given.  [oai_citation:15‡Professional Sports Authenticator (PSA)](https://www.psacard.com/gradingstandards)

## Qualifiers / Special Designations
Designators that may appear in addition to or instead of grades:

- **MK** – Marks: Writing, ink marks, pencil marks, impressions from writing.  [oai_citation:16‡Professional Sports Authenticator (PSA)](https://www.psacard.com/gradingstandards)  
- **MC** – Miscut: Exhibit atypical cut for the issue (portions of card cut off or more than one card visible).  [oai_citation:17‡Professional Sports Authenticator (PSA)](https://www.psacard.com/gradingstandards)  
- **OC** – Off-Center: Cards that are off-center will either be designated OC or be graded with the corresponding grade but reflect centering issue.  [oai_citation:18‡Professional Sports Authenticator (PSA)](https://www.psacard.com/gradingstandards)  
    - PSA determines centering by measuring the border difference; for example a 5% leeway is allowed for front centering on cards grading PSA 7 or better.  [oai_citation:19‡Professional Sports Authenticator (PSA)](https://www.psacard.com/gradingstandards)  
- **ST** – Staining: Cards with staining will be designated ST or receive a numerical grade reflecting minimum staining allowed.  [oai_citation:20‡Professional Sports Authenticator (PSA)](https://www.psacard.com/gradingstandards)  
- **PD** – Print Defect: Cards with printing defects will either get PD or a numerical grade reflecting the minimum print defect allowed.  [oai_citation:21‡Professional Sports Authenticator (PSA)](https://www.psacard.com/gradingstandards)  
- **OF** – Out of Focus or Out of Register: Cards with out-of-focus image or misregistration will either be designated OF or graded with corresponding allowance.  [oai_citation:22‡Professional Sports Authenticator (PSA)](https://www.psacard.com/gradingstandards)

## Ungradable Cards / Additional Notes
- PSA will **not** grade cards that show evidence of trimming, recoloring, restoration, tampering or questionable authenticity.  [oai_citation:23‡Professional Sports Authenticator (PSA)](https://www.psacard.com/gradingstandards)  
- Hand-cut cards (e.g., removed from panel/box) may be graded **if** they meet specific border-evidence criteria; but PSA will **not** grade traditional sheet-cut cards.  [oai_citation:24‡Professional Sports Authenticator (PSA)](https://www.psacard.com/gradingstandards)  
- Eye appeal and subjectivity: While grading is largely objective, there is a small yet significant subjective element (especially around eye appeal and centering). PSA graders reserve the right to make a judgment call when a card is borderline.  [oai_citation:25‡Professional Sports Authenticator (PSA)](https://www.psacard.com/gradingstandards)  
- Centering note: At the grader’s discretion, a small variance may be permitted based on overall eye appeal.  [oai_citation:26‡Professional Sports Authenticator (PSA)](https://www.psacard.com/gradingstandards)

## Usage / Implementation Notes
- Use these definitions as your baseline when communicating card condition in submissions, reports, or internal documentation.  
- Always reference the grade **definition** and not just the number — ensure team members understand what constitutes each grade.  
- When handling borderline cards, document the centering, gloss, corners, surface, print defects, and borders, and evaluate eye appeal according to PSA’s guideline of “what the market will accept.”  
- Qualifier designations (MK, MC, OC, ST, PD, OF) should be explicitly included in grading remarks when applicable.  
- Maintain awareness that grading standards may evolve — consider periodic review of official source material.
