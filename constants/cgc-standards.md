# CGC Cards — Grading Standards

## Introduction  
CGC uses a 10-point numeric scale to grade trading cards (TCGs, sports cards, non-sports cards).  [oai_citation:0‡CGC Cards](https://www.cgccards.com/card-grading/grading-scale/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)  
In addition:  
- There are specialty designations (e.g., Authentic, Altered) for cards that cannot receive a standard numeric grade.  [oai_citation:1‡CGC Cards](https://www.cgccards.com/about/help-center-faqs/cgc-cards-grading/about-cgc-grades/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)  
- The top-grade “Pristine 10” is reserved for cards that are **virtually flawless under 10× magnification**.  [oai_citation:2‡CGC Cards](https://www.cgccards.com/card-grading/grading-scale/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

## Specialty Designations  
- **Authentic (AU)**: Used when the card is authentic and unaltered but cannot receive a numeric grade (e.g., falls outside size tolerance or is missing a portion).  [oai_citation:20‡CGC Cards](https://www.cgccards.com/card-grading/grading-scale/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)  
- **Authentic/Altered (AA)**: Used when the card is authentic but has some alteration (e.g., recoloring, trimming).  [oai_citation:21‡thecgccomicshop.com](https://www.thecgccomicshop.com/card-grading?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

## Notes & Considerations for Your Rule Set  
- **Centering, surface, corners, edges**: While CGC does not publish sub-grades (they used to) for cards, your implementation should still check for common defect types: centering, wear on corners, edge chipping/notching, surface gloss/print spots, registration/focus issues.  [oai_citation:22‡CGC Cards](https://www.cgccards.com/about/help-center-faqs/cgc-cards-grading/about-cgc-grades/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)  
- **Magnification**: For the highest grades, inspect under 10× magnification (especially for “Pristine 10”).  [oai_citation:23‡CGC Cards](https://www.cgccards.com/card-grading/grading-scale/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)  
- **Differing criteria by card type**: For sports/non-sports cards, explicit centering thresholds are given (e.g., 60/40 for 9, 65/35 for 8, 70/30 for 7, 75/25 for 6) in the CGC description. Your rule set should support type-based thresholds.  [oai_citation:24‡CGC Cards](https://www.cgccards.com/card-grading/grading-scale/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)  
- **Branch for “too damaged / altered”**: If a card fails authentication or is altered/cleaned, it should receive the Authentic/Altered designation instead of a numeric grade.  
- **Update mapping**: Be aware CGC has made changes (e.g., to grade-names, removal of some half-point grades) that may need versioning in your system.  [oai_citation:25‡CGC Comic Book Collectors Chat Boards](https://boards.cgccomics.com/topic/523193-cgc-grading-changes/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
